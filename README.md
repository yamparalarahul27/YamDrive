# App Capture

Local desktop app for running a downloaded Android APK in an emulator, capturing the current screen, and exporting a Figma-pasteable SVG bundle. Built on Electron; the macOS UI follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, and tool discovery works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Also In This Repo

[`mobile/`](./mobile/) is a separate project: **Pitstop**, an Expo (SDK 57)
Android app for planning road-trip itineraries on Google Maps — drop stops,
find petrol nearby, order them, hand the route to Google Maps. It shares
nothing with the Electron capture tool below; see
[`mobile/README.md`](./mobile/README.md) for its setup and API keys.

## What It Builds

The app creates a capture folder under:

```text
~/Documents/App Capture/Captures/
```

Each capture contains:

- `screen.png`: exact Android screenshot.
- `hierarchy.xml`: Android UI hierarchy from `uiautomator`.
- `figma-capture.svg`: screenshot plus editable accessibility text/click-target overlays.
- `layout.json`: a Figma layout spec (frames + text with inferred auto-layout) for the importer plugin.
- `capture.json`: parsed capture metadata.
- `figma-import.json`: self-contained payload for the companion Figma plugin.

## Ways Into Figma

| Route | Output | Editable? | Auto-layout? | How |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SVG paste | `figma-capture.svg` | Yes (vectors + text) | No (absolute positions) | **Copy SVG** → paste into Figma |
| Plugin — screenshot | `figma-import.json` | Yes (text + tap-target layers over a screenshot image fill) | No | Load into the importer plugin |
| Plugin — auto-layout | `layout.json` | Yes (real frames + text) | **Yes** | **Copy Layout JSON** → paste into the importer plugin |

Figma's native editable format can't be written directly from outside, so
auto-layout is delivered through a plugin rather than the clipboard. The
companion plugin reads either `figma-import.json` or `layout.json` (auto-detected).
See [`figma-plugin/`](./figma-plugin/) for install + usage and the JSON schema.

### Image-only (no device)

The same `layout.json` shape is the contract for screenshots: hand an image +
device dimensions to a vision model (Claude/Codex), ask it to emit JSON matching
the schema in `figma-plugin/README.md`, then paste that into the importer
plugin. A complete hand-authored sample lives in
[`examples/image-only-example.layout.json`](./examples/image-only-example.layout.json).
Spacing and grouping are inferred from the image, so expect light touch-up.

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Node.js 22+
- Android Studio or Android SDK command-line tools
- At least one Android Virtual Device

The app searches for Android tools in:

- `$ANDROID_HOME`
- `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`
- `~/Library/Android/sdk` (macOS)
- `~/Android/Sdk` (Linux)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` (Windows)
- current `PATH`

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> If your shell exports `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, the Electron binary runs as
> plain Node and `require("electron")` returns a path string instead of the
> API (every API such as `app` and `nativeTheme` becomes `undefined`, crashing
> at startup). Launch with it cleared:
>
> ```bash
> unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE && npm start
> ```

## Develop

```bash
npm run check   # syntax-check every source file
npm test        # run the unit tests (node --test)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`adb was not found` / `Android Emulator was not found`** — the Android SDK
  is not installed or not discoverable. Install Android Studio
  (`brew install --cask android-studio`) and complete the **Standard** setup
  wizard, which installs `platform-tools` (`adb`) and the emulator to
  `~/Library/Android/sdk` (macOS). If the SDK lives elsewhere, set `ANDROID_HOME`
  or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` to that path.
- **No AVDs listed** — create one in Android Studio via
  **More Actions → Virtual Device Manager → Create Virtual Device**.

## Workflow

1. Start the app.
2. Select an APK.
3. Start an AVD or select a connected emulator/device.
4. Install the APK.
5. Launch the detected package.
6. Click `Live` to mirror the device inside the app and control it with the
   mouse (click to tap, drag to swipe/scroll). See "Live Engines" below.
7. Click `Capture`.
8. Click `Copy SVG`.
9. Paste into a Figma Design file.

You can also use `Copy PNG` for an exact bitmap capture.

## Live Engines

`Live` mirrors the device inside Appu so you can drive the app without leaving
the window. Two engines are used automatically:

- **scrcpy** (preferred): real-time H.264 video decoded with WebCodecs, with
  full mouse control (tap, drag, scroll). Works for emulators and real phones.
  Requires a scrcpy server jar. The app looks for it via, in order:
  - `SCRCPY_SERVER_JAR` (explicit path)
  - `~/.appu/scrcpy-server.jar`
  - a Homebrew/Linux scrcpy install (`.../share/scrcpy/scrcpy-server`)

  Install with `brew install scrcpy` (macOS) or your package manager. The server
  version must match; the app auto-detects it from an installed `scrcpy`, or set
  `SCRCPY_SERVER_VERSION`.
- **screencap** (fallback): if scrcpy isn't available, Appu falls back to polled
  `adb exec-out screencap` frames (~1 fps) with tap/swipe forwarding.

The scrcpy engine is experimental and pinned to the v2.x server protocol.

## How The Capture Works

This project intentionally uses official Android/Figma-supported surfaces:

- Android Emulator command-line + `adb install`: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline
- `adb exec-out screencap -p`: https://developer.android.com/tools/adb#screencap
- UI Automator hierarchy/accessibility surface: https://developer.android.com/training/testing/other-components/ui-automator
- Android Monkey launch by package: https://developer.android.com/studio/test/other-testing-tools/monkey
- Figma SVG paste/import: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040030374-Copy-assets-between-design-tools
- Figma Plugin API node creation path for future importer work: https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma/

The desktop UI follows macOS Human Interface Guidelines direction for sidebars, toolbars, buttons, typography, color, and materials:

- https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-macos
- https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sidebars
- https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toolbars
- https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons

- https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials

## Current Limitation

A downloaded APK does not expose a DOM or React Native component tree. Without app instrumentation, this app cannot recover exact native styles as editable Figma nodes.

The output is therefore:

```text
exact screenshot
+ accessible text layers
+ clickable/focusable bounds
+ layout.json (frames + text + inferred auto-layout)
+ capture metadata
```

When the device exposes a hierarchy, `layout.json` carries real bounds, text,
and inferred auto-layout into editable Figma nodes via the importer plugin.
Colors and exact native styles are not present in the hierarchy, so frame fills
default to neutral placeholders and are easy to adjust in Figma. For
screenshots with no hierarchy, generate `layout.json` from the image with a
vision model against the documented schema.
